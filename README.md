Repo includes Java files that show inconsistent behavior in Neo4j

Note that if one were to comment out line 31 in Tester.java the query in that same method will return an empty set.  If I leave it in the query returns valid results.  Starting up neo4j on the command line AFTER running this program and then using the web console shows this data in the neo4J repo (same directory).
